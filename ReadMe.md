## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. **MongoDB** instance (for storing gathered data).
3. **PyInstaller** (for compiling scripts into EXE format).
4. **Colorama**, **pyfiglet**, **requests**, and other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BigglesDevs/InfoThief.git
   cd InfoThief
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (venv)**:
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Follow these steps:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate on macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate on Windows
   ```

   Once activated, your terminal prompt will show `(venv)` to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB connection**: 
   Ensure that your MongoDB URI is correctly stored in the external configuration (e.g., fetched from Pastebin).

### Running the Script

To launch **InfoThief**, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Main Menu Options:
1. **Test InfoThief (On Self)**:
   - Gathers information from your own system and sends the data to a specified Discord webhook.
   - Displays and stores information in MongoDB.

2. **Create InfoThief (Distribute)**:
   - Allows you to create and distribute a personalized version of the script.
   - Customize the script with your webhook URL and optionally compile it into an executable.

3. **Exit**:
